# Slush React Native TypeScript generator [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/kristianmandrup/slush-react-native-ts-generator.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kristianmandrup/slush-react-native-ts-generator) [![NPM version](https://badge-me.herokuapp.com/api/npm/slush-react-native-ts-generator.png)](http://badges.enytc.com/for/npm/slush-react-native-ts-generator)

Use this generator to create a basic React Native app with 
TypeScript support (ie. [TSX](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/JSX)).

This generator is based on the seed project [ReactNativeTS](https://github.com/mrpatiwi/ReactNativeTS)

For info on using [TSX](http://www.jbrantly.com/typescript-and-jsx/)

### Editor/IDE

We recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 
with plugins:

- [React Native](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-react-native). 
- [React Native code-push](https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push)

Be sure to follow [VSC Updates](https://code.visualstudio.com/Updates)

## Getting Started

Install `slush-react-native-ts-generator` globally:

```bash
$ npm install -g slush-react-native-ts-generator
```

### Usage

Create a new folder for your project:

```bash
$ mkdir my-slush-react-native-ts-generator
```

Run the generator from within the new folder:

```bash
$ cd my-slush-react-native-ts-generator && slush react-native-ts-generator
```

## Getting To Know Slush

Slush is a tool that uses Gulp for project scaffolding.

Slush does not contain anything "out of the box", except the ability to locate installed slush generators and to run them with liftoff.

To find out more about Slush, check out the [documentation](https://github.com/slushjs/slush).
